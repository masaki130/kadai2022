555Lincolnshire, England, October 1149 A nightmare seized him from sleep, turned around his throat, and filled his mouth so full he could not cry out. Desperate for air, he opened his eyes onto a moonless night that denied him the face of his attacker.By allthe saints! Who dares?He struck out, but a second attacker appeared and pitched him onto his belly. Though a foul cloth had been shoved in his mouth, the loosening of hands around his throat permitted him to wheeze breath through his nose. Then he was yanked up from the blanket on which he had made his bed distant from his lordâ€™s tent.Too late realizing the error of allowing dishonor to incite him to isolation, he thrustbackward and nearly found his release.Hands gripped him harder and dragged him toward the wood.Who were these miscreants who spoke not a word? What did they intend? Would they beat him for a traitor? Worse?A noose fell past his ears. Feeling death settle on his shoulders, he knew fear that surpassed any he had known. He shouted against the cloth, struggled to shrug out from beneath the rope, splayed and hooked his useless hands.Lord, help me!The cruel hands fell from him, but as he reached for the rope, it tightened and snapped his chin to his chest. An instant later, he was hoisted off his feet. He flailed and clawed at his trussed neck but was denied even the smallest breath of air.Realizing that this night he would die for what he had intended to do...for what he had not done...for Henry, he would have sobbed like the boy he ever denied being had he the breath to do so.Unworthy! The familiar rebuke sounded through him, though it was many months since he had been called such.Aye, unworthy, for I cannot even die like a man.
